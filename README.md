# Atlas Game
Atlas is a game which can be played by any number of players but here is a simple version of the game played by two players the user and the computer.

# How the game works
The player starts by naming a country. Lets say you started with Singapore. The computer now has to name a country that begins with 'E' i.e. the last letter of the country you named. Now say the computer replies Ethiopia you (a.k.a. the user have to reply a country whose names begins with the last letter of Ethiopia i.e. 'A'. And so on and so forth the game continues until either the computer or the human rus out of names and loses

# Whats in this project
This project has a full implementation of the game for the two players nothing more and nothing less.

# What remains to be done
A full list of actual country names are yet to be put in as a list and used and the code is to be changed suitably
